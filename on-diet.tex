\section{Introduction}
Data from experiments with diet suggest several features which influence feelings of satiety and vigor:
\begin{itemize}
    \item what a subject eats,
    \item when a subject eats,
    \item how a subject eats,
    \item and the quantity eaten by a subject.
\end{itemize}

\section{ What a Subject Eats }
What a subject eats is everything ingested.

\section{ When a Subject Eats }
The time of eating and the duration of the fast between meals before a meal is a consideration woefully absent from the curricula of health classes. When may be considered with regard to frequency. A measure of when may include information about fasting.
